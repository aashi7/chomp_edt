PATH ADAPTOR
=================

Path adaptor is a basic CHOMP implementation for differential drive mobile robots.
It adapts an initial path to avoid obstacles.
This implementation is based on source code from [trychomp][]

Build and Run GUI:
-------
You need [CMake][], [Eigen][] v3, and [GTK+][] v2.

    git clone https://github.com/rafaelvalencia/path-adaptor.git
    mkdir path-adaptor/build
    cd path-adaptor/build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./demoSE2

Basic Class Usage:
------
* Declare a CHOMP object (CHOMP_SE2 or CHOMP) with your selected parameters (passed as arguments in constructor).
* Initialize a path, a starting pose and an ending pose. E.g. use  'setPath' to set any given 
initial path (e.g. computed with a global path planner), 'initStraightLinePath' for a straight line or 'initStackedPath' for a path with all poses stacked at the initial pose.
* Set obstacles with 'setObstacles' (add more with 'addObstacle', obstacles are defined as circles).
* Run CHOMP with 'generatePath' or run a single iteration with 'chompIteration' (you need an initialized path for this step).


This is based on the Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning [CHOMP][].
